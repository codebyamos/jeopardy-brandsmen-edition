=== 🎯 JEOPARDY GAME SAVING TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE ===

The reason your games aren't being saved to history is most likely because:

1. ❌ NO PLAYERS: You need to ADD PLAYERS to your game before clicking "Start New Game"

2. 🔍 HOW TO ADD PLAYERS:
   - Click the hamburger menu (≡) in the top-right corner of the game
   - Select "Manage Players" 
   - Click "Add Player" to add team members
   - Give each player a name and optionally set scores

3. ✅ CORRECT FLOW:
   - Add players to your game
   - Play the game (answer questions, score points)
   - Click "Start New Game" → This will save the current game to history
   - The new game starts fresh

4. 🚫 WHAT WON'T WORK:
   - Clicking "Start New Game" with no players → Nothing saved
   - Playing without adding players → Nothing to save

5. 🔧 DEBUG STEPS:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Click "Start New Game"
   - Look for these messages:
     * "Players length: 0" = No players, won't save
     * "Players found, proceeding to save to history" = Will save
