3. **`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`** - New component to prevent crashes
4. **`src/App.tsx`** - Added error boundary wrapper

## Technical Improvements

- **Memory Management**: Better handling of large files during base64 conversion
- **Error Recovery**: Users can retry failed uploads without refreshing
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback prevents users from thinking app is frozen
- **File Format Support**: Comprehensive support for modern image formats
- **Size Validation**: Clear feedback about file size limits

## Testing the Improvements

1. **Large File Upload**: Try uploading files up to 25MB
2. **Different Formats**: Test JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG files
3. **Error Scenarios**: Try uploading invalid files to see error messages
4. **Progress Feedback**: Upload large files to see progress indicator
5. **Error Recovery**: If upload fails, try again without refreshing

The app should no longer show white screens when uploading large images and will provide clear feedback about what's happening during the upload process.
